# Spotify QuickManager
I started this project to teach myself more about web development, about Django and Vue.js in particular.
This is a tool that allows you to view all information about your Spotify library (such as Liked Songs, Playlists, 
Artists, Albums). It's not very useful for anything, but it's mostly for my practice! :)
